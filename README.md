## Inspiration:
My Inspiring Movement Was, When I Witnessed The Amount Of Unnecessary And Complex Work Load In Dairy Farms Where People Are Struggling Because Of Their Old Ways Of Management And There Seems No Help To Improvise. That Movement Inspired Me To Be The Very Help They Need Through The Power Of Technology And Computer Programming.

## What it does:
DFMS Pledges To Cope With All The Problems And Hassle Of Work That Workers And Owners Face.

## Animal Care:>
*You Can Add Animal's And Its Information, Like Animal Type, Buying Price, Pregnancy Status, And Its Average Per Day Milk.

*There's a Module Called Reports That Contains Each And Every Report Of The Farm, From Collecting And Selling Milk To All The Reports Of Staff And Their Salary And Entire Farms Expense.

## How I built it
*DFMS Is Based Upon The Leading Framework In The Tech Industry, Called Flutter.

*Programming Language I Used In The Is Dart The Basic Language That Flutter Uses.

*App Is Powered By The Google's Own Best Backend Database Service, Firebase Firestore.


## Challenges I ran into
It Took My Hell of a Effort To Comprehend The Dairy System And Putting It All Under The Shadow Of One App.
The Bigger Challenge Was To Decode The Old And Complex Working Style Into A Simplified App.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
It is Really Peaceful To Say That I Have Accomplished The Ultimate Goal.
I'm Really Proud To Say That This Will Surely Revolutionise The Dairy Management System.
I Feel Great To Say That I Have A Hand In Making People's Life Less Difficult.

## What I learned
I Learnt The Different Processes That Farmers Go Through While Managing The Animals.
I Comprehended The Business Modal Of Farm Management.
This Even Helped Me In My Tech Industry Skills Cause I Had To Learn New Things While Developing The App.

## What's next for Dairy Farm Management System (DFMS)
I Truly Hope That The DFMS Reaches Any One And Every One Who's Out There And Need It.
The App Would Surely Go Through The Process Of Improvement And Development On The Basis Of User Experiences.
